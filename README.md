## 📌 Overview

SignalLock is an AI-driven early warning platform that detects silent, gradual failures in infrastructure systems such as water pumps, electrical panels, servers, motors, HVAC units, and UPS systems — before breakdowns occur.

Most infrastructure failures are not sudden. They develop slowly through rising vibration, irregular power draw, thermal drift, or network instability. Traditional monitoring systems detect problems only after damage has already begun.

SignalLock learns what “normal” looks like for every system and flags behavioral drift — the earliest indicator of failure.

> **We don’t wait for systems to fail. We detect when they start behaving differently.**

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Modern infrastructure relies on machines that run continuously. Their failures cause downtime, financial loss, safety risks, and service disruption.

Most failures emerge gradually as:
- Rising vibration in motors  
- Irregular power consumption  
- Thermal drift  
- Network latency instability  

Current monitoring systems:
- Use static thresholds  
- Require expensive proprietary hardware  
- Depend on manual inspection  
- Detect issues only after damage begins  

There is no affordable, learning-based system that works with small, noisy, unlabeled data.

## 🚫 Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Existing Approach | Limitation |
|------------------|------------|
| Rule-based alerts | Miss gradual degradation |
| Industrial IoT tools | Too costly for small institutions |
| Dashboards | No intelligence |
| Predictive tools | Require labeled failure data |

**Key Gap:**  
No accessible AI system that can learn system-specific behavior and detect early drift automatically.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

SignalLock is an unsupervised machine learning platform that continuously learns system behavior and detects anomalies relative to its own historical baseline.

### Core Capabilities
- Learns normal behavior patterns  
- Detects early behavioral drift  
- Assigns anomaly confidence scores  
- Explains which signals changed  
- Sends proactive alerts  
- Visualizes system health

## ⚙ How the System Works

1. Sensors or CSV feeds send time-series data  
2. FastAPI ingestion service receives data  
3. Data is streamed via Redis  
4. Stored in PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB  
5. Autoencoder learns normal patterns  
6. Drift detector monitors slow degradation  
7. Anomaly scorer assigns confidence score  
8. Alert engine triggers early warnings  
9. Dashboard visualizes health and trends

## 🚀 Scalability and Reliability

### Growth Handling

| Component | Scaling Strategy |
|----------|------------------|
| Ingestion API | Horizontal scaling via Docker |
| Queue | Redis cluster |
| Database | TimescaleDB partitioning |
| ML Engine | Worker pool |
| Dashboard | CDN hosting |
| Alerts | Retry and debouncing |

### Failure Prevention

- Queue buffering for traffic spikes  
- Stateless services for failover  
- Model fallback rules  
- Alert deduplication  
- Batched database writes
